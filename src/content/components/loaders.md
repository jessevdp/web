# Loaders
Loaders are a good way to indicate to a user that the system is working. This prevents the user from just closing a page because "It's stuck". We have 3 styles of page loaders: default, success and danger.

<div class="loader"></div>
<div class="loader loader-success"></div>
<div class="loader loader-danger"></div>
