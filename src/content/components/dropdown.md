# Dropdown
A dropdown menu can in some cases be used to clean up the navigation of a site. Sometimes sites have a million different pages and need to link to every single one of them.

In those cases it's a good idea to categorize these menu's into groups, these groups then become dropdown items.

Personally I'm not a big fan of dropdown menus. Whenever possible I try to keep everything on a few pages. Maybe 5 as a maximum â€” that way the user won't be too confused: having too many options is overwhelming!

***Of course dropdown menus have their place.***

<nav class="dropdown">
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#">Link</a></li>
    <li>
      <a href="#">Dropdown</a>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#">Option 1</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Option 2</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Option 3</a></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><a href="#">Link</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
