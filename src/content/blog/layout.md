# The layout
First of all I started by creating a layout. I decided that every blog post would have at least a header, a navigation, main content, and a footer.

### Header
Every blog post would start with a title and a short introduction. This intro would help the end used decide weather or not the post was worth reading. Every post would also get a timestamp listing the date at which it was written.

### Main content
The most important part of every blog post â€” their content. This would be one long single column of text. The content would be written in markdown. (more on that later) It's important that this single column wouldn't get too wide, long lines of text are harder and less inviting to read.

### Navigation
Time is a limited resource. When writing blog posts I want to write about useful things I've experimented with. Sometimes this might for example include background info on a new technique.

To make sure people have the option of skipping through what they already know I want to provide quick links to the main headings in the post. *Every `<h1>` becomes a link that appears in the navigation section*.

### Footer
The footer would be used to simply credit the author of the post.
