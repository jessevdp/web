# Introduction
Hi there and welcome to `project WEB`. As the introduction states this project was originally intended to serve as a style guide / css framework for my personal blog. However along the way it grew to be a little more than that.

### A little about me
My name is Jesse van der Pluijm. I'm a student computer science from the Netherlands. You can find more about me [on my website](https://jessevdp.nl).

### A little more about this project
So this project started off as a style guide for my personal blog. I then decided I could build upon this project and use it for one of my assignments in school. For this reason the project is separated into two sections.

My idea for the blog was to create it using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) â€” a static site generator. [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), the platform on which I would host my blog, just so happens to have full support for jekyll.

Jekyll, out of the box, allows for you to write content in [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) format. And markdown just so happens to be the markup language I favor.

I broke down what styles I would need for the blog:
- A layout
- Styles for whatever html markup markdown was capable of outputting

***And then came to school part.*** This school assignment had a couple of rules and some requirements. It required things like a form, a dropdown menu and animations. Things that you generally don't see on a blog, at least... not on mine.

So I decided to split things up, create the basic styles needed for the blog and then add whatever else I needed for the school assignment.
